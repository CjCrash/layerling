# The user guide

The guide at [layerling.com/guide](https://layerling.com/guide/index.html) (English) and
[layerling.com/anleitung](https://layerling.com/anleitung/index.html) (German) is written here and built into plain
static pages. It ships with the program: `npm run export` and `npm run dev` build it, nothing else to deploy.

```
docs/guide/
  de/01-erste-schritte.md     one file per chapter, the number is the order and pairs the two languages
  en/01-getting-started.md
  images/de/*.webp            the pictures, taken from the running program
  images/en/*.webp
```

## Writing a chapter

A chapter starts with `title:` and `summary:` between `---` lines, followed by Markdown: headings (`##`, `###`),
paragraphs, lists, tables, `> **Tip:**` boxes, code. Beyond that:

| Write | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `{{ui:editor.tool.group}}` | the button's name, **read from the interface's own texts** (`messages.de.ts` / `messages.en.ts`), so a renamed button is renamed here, and a key that no longer exists stops the build |
| `[[Ctrl]]+[[Z]]` | keys |
| `[text](chapter:solids-and-holes)` | a link to another chapter of the same language, by its file name without the number |
| `![Caption](shot:hole-after)` | a picture from `images/<language>/hole-after.webp`, with the caption below |
| `{{shortcuts}}` | the table of keyboard shortcuts, read from `ShortcutsModal.tsx` |

**Never type a button's name by hand.** Use `{{ui:...}}`. Explain in your own words, name in the program's words.

**A new feature gets its lines in the guide** - together with the welcome text (`welcome.*`) and its MCP action. The
test `tests/unit/guide.test.ts` checks that both languages have the same chapters and pictures, that every interface
name, chapter link and picture exists, and that every MCP tool is named in the AI chapter.

## The pictures

The pictures are taken by `scripts/guide-screenshots.mjs`, scene by scene (`scripts/guide-scenes.mjs`), once per
language. A scene builds its situation through the MCP bridge and the real buttons, so it needs the development server:

```
npm run dev -- -p 3010
npm run guide:images                                  # everything, both languages
node scripts/guide-screenshots.mjs --only fillet-tool --lang de
```

Do not edit source files while the run is going; the editor reloads and the scene times out. Take the pictures anew
before each release so the guide shows the current interface.

A new picture needs a scene in `guide-scenes.mjs` that calls `ctx.shot("<name>")`. Scenes find buttons through
`ctx.t("<message key>")`, so they work in both languages.
