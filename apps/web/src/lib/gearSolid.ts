/*
 * The exact body of a helical gear, as its display mesh draws it
 * (`createGearGeometry`): the tooth ring turned evenly from foot to top.
 *
 * Every corner of the ring climbs on a helix of its own radius, all with the
 * same pitch. A side of the ring stays a straight line at every height - the
 * same turn moves both its ends - so each side face is the ruled surface
 * between the helices of its two corners, which a ruled loft between the two
 * helix edges builds. Those faces and the two flat ends are sewn into one
 * solid, without a boolean; the mesh's stretch to width x depth follows, and
 * last the straight round bore is cut through it.
 *
 * Built with the axis on z (the kernel's helix frame) and stood up on y.
