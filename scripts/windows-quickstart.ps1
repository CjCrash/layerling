.SYNOPSIS
    Installs everything needed to run layerling locally on Windows, then starts it.

.DESCRIPTION
    For a freshly installed Windows machine with nothing set up yet. Installs Git for
    Windows and Node.js via winget if they are missing, downloads layerling from GitHub
    (or updates an existing local copy), installs its dependencies with npm, and starts
    the local dev server.

    Safe to run again later: if layerling is already present at -InstallPath, this script
    updates it with "git pull" instead of downloading it a second time. That also makes it
    the way to update layerling once it is installed.

    Source: https://github.com/henmedia/layerling/blob/main/scripts/windows-quickstart.ps1
    Have a look before you run a script from the internet - that link always shows the
    exact version this file describes.

.PARAMETER InstallPath
    Where to put (or find) the layerling folder. Defaults to "$env:USERPROFILE\layerling".
    To choose another place (another drive, say), run the script with this parameter:
    & ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henmedia/layerling/main/scripts/windows-quickstart.ps1))) -InstallPath "D:\3DPrinter\Layerling"

.PARAMETER NoStart
    Install and update everything, but do not start the dev server or open a browser tab.
